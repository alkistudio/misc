Script for toggling between light and dark mode for Windows 10/11 system. It works by querying the Windows registry for `AppsUseLightTheme` (at its default path) and switching the value accordingly.
## Instructions
- Either download the code, or create a new text document and rename as `filename.cmd`.

- And choose a keyboard shortcut. I chose F10, of course this can be anything. You might find that Ctrl+Alt+__ with some keyboard character might work more consistently as I believe it will not trigger if your current application has something else assigned to that key (e.g. F11).
